Dark blue vs code theme (forked "bearded theme arc eolstorm").
Tried to keep it as blue/purple as possible, but had to add some contrast (little bit of green). 
2 versions of theme for functions 
- pink that matches blue/purple type of style 
- yellow cuz I'm used to dark+ vs code standart dark theme.

Colors UPD last version 04.03.2024:<br>
Functions = Pink Underlined, Variables = White Underlined, Parameters = Greenish, <br>
Imported Component = Purple,<br>
Conditional Logic = Mostly Pink (so it doesnt blend with purple components), but Async and Flow (return, await) = Purple<br>
Everything else = Blue (darker and softer)<br>
Kinda updating Pink Version = less harsh white text, mixed pink logic (so it doesnt blend with purple imported tags) etc
