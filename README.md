Dark blue vs code theme (forked "bearded theme arc eolstorm").
Tried to keep it as blue/purple as possible, but had to add some contrast (little bit of green). 
2 versions of theme for functions 
- pink that matches blue/purple type of style 
- yellow cuz I'm used to dark+ vs code standart dark theme.

White color - variables, underlined if were mentioned before (I guess). pink/yellow - functions, greenish - parameters, purple - logic and react tags, blue - everything else
