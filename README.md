Visual Studio Code dark theme forked from beared arc blue theme
Tried to keep it as blue/purple as possible, but had to add some contrast (yellow and little bit of green), didnt like pink and red here

White color - variables, underlined if were mentioned before (I guess). yellowish - functions, greenish - parameters, purple - logic, blue - everything else
